# Tic Tac Toe Game

I got bored in the office, so I made this Tic Tac Toe game for passing the time.

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React. It's a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player game: Play against a friend locally.
- Responsive design: Play on any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
- Winning detection: The game detects when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- Reset option: Reset the game to play again.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Used for styling the game board and components.
- JavaScript: Used for game logic and event handling.

## Getting Started

To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.
